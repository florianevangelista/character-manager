## Objectives 

- Consolidate Javascript knowledge, especially Async/await
- Use an API with HTTP requests

## The job

A Comics fan client would like to manage his favorites characters on a dashboard. He contacts us to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters. 

In this project, we used the [Character Database API](https://character-database.becode.xyz/) to make/fetch a Character Manager.  
  
This is a frontend project, We had to care about the appearance of your application and create a custom template.
